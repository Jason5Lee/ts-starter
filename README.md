# TypeScript Starter Template

Based on [microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter).

This library is designed to be generic for the package manager. It supports `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn`. Edit `package.json` to add your information, then run `npm/pnpm/yarn install` to initialize.

Note that if you are using yarn, you need to add related entries in `.gitignore`. The entries depend on whether you are using zero-installs. Check [the official doc about which files should be gitignored](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored).
