# TypeScript Starter Template

This template is derived from [microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter).

In the `package.json` file, replace every occurrence of `\"$npm_execpath\"` with your preferred package manager, for instance, `npm`, `pnpm`, or `yarn`. Then tailor these files according to your needs.

If you've chosen to use `yarn`, remember to add the relevant entries into the `.gitignore` file. The entries will differ based on whether you've decided to use zero-installs. Consult [the official documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/qa#which-files-should-be-gitignored) for guidance on which files should be included in `.gitignore`.

Please refer to the `main-esm` branch for the TypeScript template that utilizes ESM.
